# fenv

`fenv` is a CLI tool that helps manage multiple versions of flutter SDKs in
your local machine. `fenv` does never use symbolic links to replace the flutter
SDK and does never require any other dependencies.

This is a premature hobby project and currently work-in-progress.
This project is highly inspired by [pyenv][], which are mostly implemented with
`bash` scripts.
